# REST-API-with-Node

Basic REST API created with Node JS on an Express Server. The API provides the functionality to upload and fetch data of orders and products on MongoDB database.
The user can upload text data in JSON format and images (using Multer) on the server.
This project helped me understand the vital features of RESTful API, it's stateless service and error handling.
